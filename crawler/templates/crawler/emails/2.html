Introverts are a misunderstood bunch. Compared to extroverts, they think differently, act differently, and even look differently when they interact with people. But there are a lot of misconceptions about what it means to be “introverted.” Here are 15 of them:

Misconception #1: Introverts are shy.
Being “shy” and “introverted” are two completely different things. Introverts are not necessarily shy or afraid of people. They don’t just don’t prefer talking for the sake of talking.

Misconception #2: Introverts are unemotional.
Introverts may not show emotion with their facial expressions and gestures, but this doesn’t mean they’re not interested in what you’re saying. Introverts prefer to control their emotions around others and internalize them. Although someone who’s introverted may not appear engaged, this is usually not the case.

Misconception #3: Introverts don’t like working in groups.
Introverts often do their best work alone, so co-workers may misunderstand them and think they don’t want to partake in group work. While introverts do have a tendency to shut down in larger groups of people when they feel like their voice isn’t being heard, introverts excel in small group situations and enjoy working in these types of environments, as long as their opinion is valued.

Misconception #4: Introverts don’t like talking.
It’s not that introverts don’t like to talk, it’s that they prefer to listen before they talk. Introverts choose their words carefully and they think small talk is a waste of time. But, they’re more than willing to engage you in a deep conversation about topics they’re passionate about.

Misconception #5: Introverts are scared to look you in the eye.
In general, introverts may not make eye contact with you as much as extroverts. This is because they don’t feel the need to partake in social norms and rituals as much as extroverts, not because they’re “scared.”
